    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
        Taiwanese popcorn chicken is a popular street food known for its crispy, bite-sized pieces of marinated chicken, deep-fried with a light, flavorful coating. It's typically seasoned with five-spice powder, garlic, and Thai basil leaves, giving it a bold, aromatic crunch that's both savory and slightly peppery.
